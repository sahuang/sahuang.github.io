# About

I’m currently a Web3 Security Researcher at [**OtterSec**](https://osec.io). Before that, I worked as a software engineer at Microsoft Vancouver. I play CTFs as my main hobby and founded [**Project Sekai CTF**](https://sekai.team/), a top-tier international team.

My interests span cryptography, reverse engineering, and blockchain security, with occasional side quests in competitive programming and AI. I’ve competed as ACM-ICPC regional finalist and DEFCON CTF 32 & 33 finalist.

Outside security, I’m a huge arcade rhythm game enjoyer (Chunithm 虹レ / Maimai 14k). I’m also a retired [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/sahuang) player and former Beatmap Nominator.
