# Overview

I played LITCTF 2022 under my `CryptoCTF` team [isanapap](https://ctftime.org/team/159278) and we won the first place again xD. There are several high quality challenges and I would like to make a writeup on one challenge, namely `You Know The Rules And So Do I` in reverse category.

# Static Analysis

So we are given a binary `main` and a bmp file `yougotrickrolledChallenge.bmp` (rickrolled again).

```zsh
% file main
main: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=2ed7f43e347752980af5e81aeceeb180a2657886, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

Great, it is unstripped. Now we can analyze the binary statically. I used `IDA Pro` and decompiled the code. The most important parts are `main` and `alter` which is called inside `main`.

```cpp
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
    int v3; // edx
    unsigned __int8 v5; // [rsp+3h] [rbp-21Dh] BYREF
    int i; // [rsp+4h] [rbp-21Ch]
    int j; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-218h]
    int k; // [rsp+Ch] [rbp-214h]
    int m; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-210h]
    int n; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-20Ch]
    int ii; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-208h]
    int v12; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-204h]
    int v13; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-200h]
    int v14; // [rsp+24h] [rbp-1FCh]
    int jj; // [rsp+28h] [rbp-1F8h]
    int kk; // [rsp+2Ch] [rbp-1F4h]
    int mm; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-1F0h]
    int nn; // [rsp+34h] [rbp-1ECh]
    FILE *stream; // [rsp+38h] [rbp-1E8h]
    FILE *v20; // [rsp+40h] [rbp-1E0h]
    FILE *v21; // [rsp+48h] [rbp-1D8h]
    char v22[400]; // [rsp+50h] [rbp-1D0h]
    char ptr[56]; // [rsp+1E0h] [rbp-40h] BYREF
    unsigned __int64 v24; // [rsp+218h] [rbp-8h]

    v24 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
    stream = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    if ( !stream )
    {
        puts("Error: The flag file does not exist");
        exit(0);
    }
    if ( !fread(ptr, 0x32uLL, 1uLL, stream) )
    {
        puts("Error: The flag is too short");
        exit(0);
    }
    for ( i = 0; i <= 49; ++i )
    {
        for ( j = 0; j <= 7; ++j )
        v22[8 * i + j] = (((int)(unsigned __int8)ptr[i] >> (7 - j)) & 1) != 0;
    }
    v20 = fopen("yougotrickrolled.bmp", "r");
    v21 = fopen("yougotrickrolledChallenge.bmp", "w");
    for ( k = 0; k <= 137; ++k )
    {
        fread(&v5, 1uLL, 1uLL, v20);
        fputc(v5, v21);
    }
    for ( m = 0; m <= 799; ++m )
    {
        for ( n = 0; n <= 1199; ++n )
        {
        for ( ii = 0; ii <= 2; ++ii )
            fread(&grid[3600 * m + 3 * n + ii], 1uLL, 1uLL, v20);
        }
    }
    v12 = 0;
    v13 = 0;
    v14 = 0;
    for ( jj = 0; jj <= 399; ++jj )
    {
        alter(&grid[3600 * v12 + 3 * v13], v14, v22[jj]);
        v3 = v14 + 1;
        v14 = (v14 + 1) / 24;
        v14 = v3 - 24 * v14;
        if ( v22[jj] )
        ++v12;
        else
        ++v13;
    }
    for ( kk = 0; kk <= 799; ++kk )
    {
        for ( mm = 0; mm <= 1199; ++mm )
        {
        for ( nn = 0; nn <= 2; ++nn )
            fputc(grid[3600 * kk + 3 * mm + nn], v21);
        }
    }
    fclose(stream);
    fclose(v20);
    fclose(v21);
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
unsigned __int8 *__fastcall alter(unsigned __int8 *a1, int a2, unsigned __int8 a3)
{
    unsigned __int8 *result; // rax

    result = &a1[a2 / 8];
    *result ^= (a3 ^ ((((int)*result >> (a2 % 8)) & 1) != 0)) << (a2 % 8);
    return result;
}
```

I splitted `main` into 3 parts, and let's deep dive into them.

## Part 1

```cpp
stream = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
if ( !stream )
{
    puts("Error: The flag file does not exist");
    exit(0);
}
if ( !fread(ptr, 0x32uLL, 1uLL, stream) )
{
    puts("Error: The flag is too short");
    exit(0);
}
for ( i = 0; i <= 49; ++i )
{
    for ( j = 0; j <= 7; ++j )
    v22[8 * i + j] = (((int)(unsigned __int8)ptr[i] >> (7 - j)) & 1) != 0;
}
```

This part is fairly easy to understand, as we read from `flag.txt` and store the flag in `ptr`. Then we iterate through the flag and convert each character to 8 bits and store in `v22`. (`v22` is a bit array of size 8 * 50 = 400 bits)

Fun fact, the above code explanation is auto-generated by `Copilot` :)

## Part 2

```cpp
v20 = fopen("yougotrickrolled.bmp", "r");
v21 = fopen("yougotrickrolledChallenge.bmp", "w");
for ( k = 0; k <= 137; ++k )
{
    fread(&v5, 1uLL, 1uLL, v20);
    fputc(v5, v21);
}
for ( m = 0; m <= 799; ++m )
{
    for ( n = 0; n <= 1199; ++n )
    {
    for ( ii = 0; ii <= 2; ++ii )
        fread(&grid[3600 * m + 3 * n + ii], 1uLL, 1uLL, v20);
    }
}
```

In this part we just read from `yougotrickrolled.bmp`, store the pixels in `grid` and also write/copy to `yougotrickrolledChallenge.bmp`. Note that `grid` size is `3 * 800 * 1200`, as image width is 1200, height is 800 and there are RGB channels. A fun fact not used in this challenge is that `C` parses bmp pixels in order of BGR, the reverse of Python `Pillow`.

## Part 3

```cpp
v12 = 0;
v13 = 0;
v14 = 0;
for ( jj = 0; jj <= 399; ++jj )
{
    alter(&grid[3600 * v12 + 3 * v13], v14, v22[jj]);
    v3 = v14 + 1;
    v14 = (v14 + 1) / 24;
    v14 = v3 - 24 * v14;
    if ( v22[jj] )
    ++v12;
    else
    ++v13;
}
```

This is the key part as it is where we alter the pixels in `grid` according to `v22` bit array. We will need to determine if a given grid has been modified in order to reverse `v22` array and thus get the flag.

My first idea was to feed `alter` some numbers and observe the output.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

uint8_t alter(uint8_t a1, int a2, uint8_t a3) {
  uint8_t result;

  result = a1;
  result ^= (a3 ^ ((((int)result >> (a2 % 8)) & 1) != 0)) << (a2 % 8);
  return result;
}

int main()
{
    printf("%d\n", alter(209, 0, 0));
    printf("%d\n", alter(209, 0, 1));
    printf("%d\n", alter(208, 0, 0));
    printf("%d\n", alter(208, 0, 1));

    return 0;
}
```

Note that `a2` can only take values from 0 to 23, and `a3` is either 0 or 1. The output of this program is 208, 209, 208, 209 - so it seems that output is even number when `a3` is 0 and odd number when `a3` is 1. However this will not work if `a2` is not 0. So checking if the pixel is even or odd is not going to work.

My solution to this is surprisingly simple. We are given the result of `alter(&grid[3600 * v12 + 3 * v13], v14, v22[jj])`, we know `v14` and we need to get `v22[jj]`. We can brute force all possible combinations of `grid` and `v22`, where `grid` value is from 32 to 126 and `v22` is 0 or 1. In the end it turns out that `grid` can have different values but `v22` will always be fixed.

Note that in original `alter`, we have `result = &a1[a2 / 8];` which means it is getting offset 0, 1, or 2 depending on `a2` value which ranges from 0 to 23.

Solve script is attached below. I used a struct to store the image and auto-parsed the bmp file instead of hard-coding its header size, width, or height.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdint.h>

// image info with width, height and pixels
typedef struct {
    int w, h;
    unsigned char *px;
    unsigned char *head;
    int header; // header size
} image_t;

image_t parse_bmp(char* fname) {
    image_t x;

    FILE *tempfile = fopen(fname, "rb");
    if (!tempfile) {
        exit(1);
    }
    unsigned char* tmp = malloc(16 * sizeof(unsigned char));
    fread(tmp, sizeof(unsigned char), 16, tempfile);
    x.header = tmp[11] * 256 + tmp[10];
    fclose(tempfile);

    FILE *file = fopen(fname, "rb");
    x.head=malloc(x.header * sizeof(unsigned char));
    fread(x.head, sizeof(unsigned char), x.header, file);
    x.w = x.head[19] * 256 + x.head[18];
    x.h = x.head[23] * 256 + x.head[22];

    fseek(file, x.header, SEEK_SET);
    x.px = calloc(x.w * x.h * 3, sizeof(unsigned char));
    unsigned char *curr_pixel = calloc(1, sizeof(unsigned char));
    for(int i = 0; i < x.w * x.h * 3; i++) {
        fread(curr_pixel, 1, 1, file);
        x.px[i] = curr_pixel[0];
    }
    free(curr_pixel);
    fclose(file);
    return x;
}

unsigned char alter(unsigned char a1, int a2, unsigned char a3) {
  unsigned char result = a1;
  result ^= (a3 ^ ((((int)result >> (a2 % 8)) & 1) != 0)) << (a2 % 8);
  return result;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	image_t x = parse_bmp("yougotrickrolledChallenge.bmp");

    printf("Width: %d, Height: %d, Header: %d\n", x.w, x.h, x.header);

    int v3 = 0, v12 = 0, v13 = 0, v14 = 0;
    int flag[400];

    for (int jj = 0; jj <= 399; ++jj) {
        int curr = 0;
        if (v14 < 8) curr = x.px[3600 * v12 + 3 * v13 + 0];
        else if (v14 < 16) curr = x.px[3600 * v12 + 3 * v13 + 1];
        else curr = x.px[3600 * v12 + 3 * v13 + 2];
        // Brute force all combinations
        int cc[2]; cc[0] = 0; cc[1] = 0;
        for (int u = 1; u < 256; u++) {
            for (int v = 0; v <= 1; v++) {
                if (alter(u, v14, v) == curr) {
                    cc[v]++;
                }
            }
        }
        // cc will always be (2,0) or (0,2)!
        flag[jj] = (cc[0] > cc[1]) ? 0 : 1;

        v3 = v14 + 1;
        v14 = (v14 + 1) / 24;
        v14 = v3 - 24 * v14;
        if (flag[jj] == 1)
            ++v12;
        else
            ++v13;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 400; i+=8) {
        // binary to int
        int curr = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            curr = curr * 2 + flag[i+j];
        }
        printf("%c", curr);
    }

	return 0;
}
```

This will give the flag `LITCTF{h0n3stly_im_n0t_sur3_1f_rick_r0ll3d_mys3lf}`.

# Conclusion

This challenge is not really difficult, as the binary is unstripped and the code is not obfuscated. Probably some people are unfamiliar with bmp images or uncomfortable with using C/C++ for exploit. It is a nice challenge, probably my favourite in the CTF.

On a side note, I made a quite similar challenge in [vsCTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1658) less than a month ago, with a binary encrypting a bmp file. That challenge is more difficult since I stripped the binary plus used quite some obfuscation on pixel shift. If you want to have a try, check the challenge [here](https://github.com/sahuang/my-ctf-challenges/tree/main/vsctf-2022/Reverse/Hex-A-Gone)!
