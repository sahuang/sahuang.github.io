## Overview

This weekend, I played [HKCERT CTF 2022](https://ctf.hkcert.org/) upon invitation from [Mystiz](https://mystiz.hk/), member of team [Black Bauhinia](https://b6a.black/). The competition is mainly for Hong Kong players and we joined as an invitational team. Overall I had a great time solving many of the challenges and we ended up in the first place with a narrow margin.

Thanks to my teammates *Utaha*, *ElleuchX1*, and *Piers* for playing!

I decided to writeup some of the challenges that I found interesting.
