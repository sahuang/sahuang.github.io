# CTF Writeups

This website will contain writeups for CTF challenges that I solved (or created). The solutions will probably not be the optimal so feel free to correct me or discuss with me if you want to improve my blogs!

# About Me

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft in Vancouver, Canada. I play CTFs as my main hobby besides gaming. Founder of [**Project Sekai CTF**](https://sekai.team/), one of the top CTF teams internationally. I mainly do cryptography and reverse engineering, occasionally misc, programming, or machine learning.
